The no-dependency version is rarely modified due to the very rare use it sees compared to the other version.

I still welcome feature requests to this version of PSTR and will addresses bugs as quickly as possible, but I highly 
recommend that you use the other version if you have no restrictions on software dependencies in your organizations.
